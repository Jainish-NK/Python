polymorphism : many forms of the function
2 type of polymorphism are there 
1)compile time polymorphism : function overloading,operator overloading
2)runtime polymorphism : function overriding


function overloading : same function name but different num of parameters or different type of parameters
in python it is not supported directly but we can achieve it using default parameters or variable length arguments (*args, **kwargs).


operator overriding 
parent class method created and child class method created with same name

operator overloading;
operator are use for performing operations on object of user defined class.
In python , you can overload operators by defining special methods in your class.
These methods are prefixed and suffixed with double underscores (dunder methods).
For example, to overload the addition operator (+), you would define the `__add__` method in your class.
